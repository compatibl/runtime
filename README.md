to the project.

2. The project's versioning system is the sole method for recording all
individual contributions and the associated copyright details.

have no bearing on copyright ownership and does not constitute copyright
assignment to the employer.

copyright notices in project files must specify The Project Contributors
and never an individual copyright holder:
